# XSS Vulnerable Website

This repository contains a deliberately vulnerable website created for educational purposes to demonstrate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The website aims to educate users on the risks associated with improper handling of user input.

**DISCLAIMER: This website is intentionally vulnerable and should only be used for educational purposes. Do NOT deploy this in any production environment. Use it responsibly and ethically.**

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to illustrate the dangers of XSS vulnerabilities by showcasing:

- A comment box functionality that stores user input in a database.
- Displaying user-generated comments without proper sanitization, leading to potential script execution.

## Features

- The PHP code retrieves and displays comments from a database without proper input validation.
- Demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts.
